A. Define a class Person, and two inherited classes: Professor and 
Student.
 The base class Person has two data members: name (a string) and
id (an int), a constructor, and a member function displayPerson()
to display name and id.
 The derived class Student has a data member nPapers (an int
represents the no. of research papers published by the student and
his/her supervisor), a constructor, and a member function: paper()
that returns the no. of papers.
 The derived class Professor has two data members: StudentList
(an array of Student objects that holds the students supervised by
the professor) and nStudent (an int represents the no. of those
students), a constructor, and three member functions:
registerStudent() that accepts a Student object and enters it in the
array StudentList, Total() that calculates and returns the total no.
of papers published by the professor and his students, and
displayStudent() that displays the data of the students supervised
by the professor.
B. Write a main program that reads a professor's name and id, and
creates a Professor object for that professor. Then, the programs read a
series of students' names, ids, and no. of papers, until the name XXX is
entered. For each student, a Student object is created and entered to the
array StudentList of the Professor object by registering that student with
the professor. After all students have been entered, the data of the
students supervised by the professor are displayed, then the total no. of
papers published by the professor and his students is calculated and
displayed.
C. Update class account add friend function :
Friend double transfer (account acct1, account acct2, double amt)
To transfer amount form second account, if it less than or equal balance
of the second account, and add it to first account and then returns amount.
